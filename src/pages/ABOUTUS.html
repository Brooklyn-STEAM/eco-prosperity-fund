      <p class="text-center text-1xl md:text-2xl">
        Our business is called eco prosperity fund, EPF for short. Our goal is
        to help low income indiviuals with investing in things that will benefit
        them in the future. Now how we execute this plan is teaching those
        indiviuals financial literacy which is key when managing money. After
        they finish their full course we use the donantions to give a rough
        estimate of $100 so they can grow that amount by hundreds or even
        thousands. The point of our business is growth, we want to see people
        win.

      <p>MEET THE TEAM!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-center text-1xl md:text-2xl">
      The team contains of 4 fullstack development students from the Brooklyn
      STEAM center. As a team this plan was decided on because we realized that
      there are a lot of indiviuals that don't know how to invest or just use
      their money properly because they weren't given the chance to learning
      financial literacy. Us students want to spread our knowledge in hopes of
      people gaining from it.
