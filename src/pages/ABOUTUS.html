Our business is called eco prosperity fund, EPF for short. Our goal is to help low income indiviuals with investing in things that will benefit them in the future. Now how we execute this plan is teaching those indiviuals financial literacy which is key when managing money. After they finish their full course we use the donantions to give a rough estimate of $100 so they can grow that amount by hundreds or even thousands.
