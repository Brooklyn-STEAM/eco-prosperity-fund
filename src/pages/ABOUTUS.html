    <p> The team contains of 4 fullstack development students from the Brooklyn STEAM center. As a team this plan was decided on because we realixed that there are a lot of indiviuals that don't know how to invest or just use there money properly because they weren't given the chance to experience financial literacy. Us students want to spread our previous knowledge in hopes of people gaining a lot from us. </p>

Our business is called eco prosperity fund, EPF for short. Our goal is to help low income indiviuals with investing in things that will benefit them in the future. Now how we execute this plan is teaching those indiviuals financial literacy which is key when managing money. After they finish their full course we use the donantions to give a rough estimate of $100 so they can grow that amount by hundreds or even thousands.
