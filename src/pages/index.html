      Our Purpose!
    </h1>
    <p class="justify-self-start px-8 text-2xl max-sm:text-center">
      Our purpose is to empower individuals in underserved and economically
      disadvantaged communities by providing them with the financial knowledge,
      skills, and resources they need to transform their lives. We believe that
      everyone deserves the opportunity to achieve financial stability and
      independence, regardless of their background or income level. Through
      comprehensive education, hands-on training, and ongoing support, we help
      individuals build the confidence and capability to manage their money
      wisely, plan for the future, and make informed financial decisions. Our
      goal is to create a ripple effect of economic empowerment that extends
      beyond individuals to families, neighborhoods, and entire communities,
      fostering long-term prosperity and resilience.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p class="justify-self-start px-8 text-2xl max-sm:text-center">
      Across the country, there exists a significant and persistent gap in
      financial literacy—especially among low-income populations and
      marginalized communities. Many individuals lack access to basic financial
      education and tools, making it difficult to navigate everyday financial
      decisions, avoid debt traps, and plan for long-term goals like
      homeownership, entrepreneurship, or retirement. This knowledge gap
      contributes to a cycle of poverty that is difficult to escape and limits
      opportunities for upward economic mobility. At EcoProsperity, we recognize
      that addressing this disparity is not only a matter of individual
      empowerment but also a critical step toward achieving greater economic
      equity and social justice. By providing culturally relevant, accessible,
      and actionable financial education, we aim to break down barriers, open
      new pathways, and inspire lasting economic transformation.

      Our Motive !
    </h1>
    <div class="flex flex-col justify-center md:flex-row mb-5">
      <p class="text-lg p-3 max-sm:text-center">
        We are a Group of Teens Who established a goal to empower people to make
        smart money decisions so they can live more secure, independent, and
        stress-free lives.
      </p>
      <p class="p-3 text-lg max-w-450 max-sm:text-center">
        We realized that most people—especially young adults like us—aren’t
        taught how to manage Their money benefitially. We’ve seen friends and
        family struggle with debt, budgeting, and understanding credit, and we
        don’t want that cycle to continue. We believe that learning about money
        early can change someone’s entire future, so we’re stepping up to share
        what we’ve learned and make financial literacy more accessible to our
        community.
