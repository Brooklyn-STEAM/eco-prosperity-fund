        <p class="font-sans text-emerald-700 p-4 text-lg lg:w-90"> 
            There is a significant gap in financial literacy, particularly among low-income populations, which limits opportunities for upward economic mobility. By providing financial education and practical tools, EcoProsperity sees a unique opportunity to help these individuals break the cycle of poverty.
        
        One unit is defined as a completed financial education course or workshop, where participants learn core financial skills such as budgeting, saving, managing debt, and investing. Each course is designed to be delivered both online and in-person, reaching low-income communities through partnerships with local organizations and outreach efforts.
