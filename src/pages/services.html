        What are we Providing
      </h2>
      <p class="font-sans text-emerald-700 p-4 text-2xl lg:w-120">
        There is a significant gap in financial literacy, particularly among
        low-income populations, which limits opportunities for upward economic
        mobility. By providing financial education and practical tools,
        EcoProsperity sees a unique opportunity to help these individuals
        break the cycle of poverty. One unit is defined as a completed
        financial education course or workshop, where participants learn core
        financial skills such as budgeting, saving, managing debt, and
        investing. Each course is designed to be delivered both online and
        in-person, reaching low-income communities through partnerships with
        local organizations and outreach efforts.
